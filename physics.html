        <h1>Department profile</h1>
        <p>
            The departmentâ€™s origins can be traced back to 1962 when it was set up to offer under-grad degrees to students with an inclination towards physics.<br>
             In just a few years, in 1993, the department also added a post-grad degree to its course offerings.<br>
             Today there is also a research centre where students can further their passion for the subject.
             <br>
              Committed staff under the guidance of Dr. P. C. Pingale,
               a well-stocked library and the latest curriculum has been instrumental in generating a success rate of 82% for the UG program and 90% for the PG one.
